# Overview

In the first three modules, we covered the NOMAD features through its Graphical User Interface (GUI). However, NOMAD has much more to offer, especially when it comes to aligning with the FAIR principles for Research Data Management (RDM). One key feature is the ability to access data programmatically through its Application Programming Interface (API), which strongly supports the accessibility and reusability of the data.

Understanding and utilizing the NOMAD API opens up new possibilities for researchers. It serves as a gateway to a more dynamic, efficient, and customizable research and analysis experience. With the NOMAD API you will be able to:

- **Filter Data Efficiently**: Build customized datasets for specific needs, such as machine learning applications.
- **Automate Tasks**: Streamline data collection, retrieval, and analysis through automation.

In this module, you will learn how to:

* **Set up your programming environment**: Prepare both local and cloud-based environments for using the NOMAD API.
* **Understand API basics**: Gain an understanding of essential API concepts and HTTP methods.
* **Retrieve data from NOMAD using API**: Explore practical examples of making API calls, using pagination for large datasets, and leveraging API helpers available in the NOMAD GUI.
* **Upload data using API**: Discover how to authenticate with the API, create datasets and upload your data programmatically.
