## Setting up your programming environment
To use NOMAD programmatically, you need to set up an appropriate programming environment. There are two suggested approaches:

1.  **Local installation**: Download and install Python 3 along with the required libraries on your machine.
2.  **Cloud-based solutions**: Alternatively, cloud platforms offer convenient, ready-to-use environments. Among several options, we suggest the [NOMAD Remote Tools Hub (NORTH)](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/gui/analyze/north) as it offers an optimized experience tailored to NOMAD users.
