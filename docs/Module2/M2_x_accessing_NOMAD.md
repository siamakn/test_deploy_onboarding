# Navigating to NOMAD

The [NOMAD landing page](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/) provides an overview of different NOMAD solutions as well as its features and functionalities, along with links to documentation, tutorials, and project history. This is the starting point for accessing the NOMAD, where you can upload, manage, and explore data.

You can access the official NOMAD by clicking on the blue ``OPEN NOMAD``
button on the top right of the page.

However, there are other access points to NOMAD. While in this Module we mainly focus on using the official NOMAD release, it is worth to have a brief overview of other NOMAD installations. In order to see the list of these installations, scroll down the The [NOMAD landing page](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/) to reach the bottom of the page, and locate **Installations** header at the right side of the bottom blue ribbon.
