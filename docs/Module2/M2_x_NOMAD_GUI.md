# The NOMAD Graphical User Interface

The NOMAD Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed to provide quick access to your data management needs, such as, publishing and managing your own research data, exploring published data on NOMAD, and analyzing data. Here the main features and functionalities of the NOMAD GUI are briefly reviewed. Detailed guides for each functionality will be provided separately.

To access the NOMAD GUI, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and go to [nomad-lab.eu](https://nomad-lab.eu).

## NOMAD Landing Page

The NOMAD Landing Page is essentially the 'Explore' tab, displaying all entries that have been published in NOMAD. It also provides access to different functionalities offered by NOMAD to publish, explore, and analyze research data in separate tabs.

### Main Menus of the NOMAD GUI

1. **PUBLISH**: This section is relevant for publishing your data. It allows you to:
    - Upload or publish new data.
    - Manage datasets, which may include multiple uploads.
    - Search within the data that you have uploaded.

2. **EXPLORE**: The Explore tab allows you to explore all the data that have been published in NOMAD, or shared with you if you are logged in. You can explore data based on different aspects, currently categorized into three main categories: Theoretical data, Experimental data, and data based on their use cases, such as research data relevant to solar cells, metal-organic frameworks, or heterogeneous catalysis.

3. **ANALYZE**: This section provides links to tools for data analysis directly from the GUI. This includes:
    - Accessing data on NOMAD using its API.
    - Browsing the NOMAD Metainfo Schema to search for specific quantities and locate data or metadata of interest.
    - Utilizing a programming environment to run analysis codes, including Jupyter notebooks to analyze or visualize your data, and other analysis tools within NOMAD.

In addition to these three main tabs for data management functionalities, you will also find important and frequently required information, such as:

4. **ABOUT**: This section provides information about NOMAD, including:
    - General information and an overview of NOMAD.
    - A link to a public forum, the matsci.org, where topics relevant to NOMAD are discussed among NOMAD users and developers.
    - A link to the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). (This link is currently not functional.)
    - The NOMAD Documentation, the main available source for informative materials about NOMAD, such as tutorials, how-to guides, domain-specific examples, and explainations.
    - The main NOMAD GitLab Project, allowing access to the source code NOMAD.
    - Terms of use of NOMAD.

Please note that certain tabs and sections require logging in. At the top right of the GUI, you will find the ``LOGIN / REGISTER`` button for this purpose. There is also a ``Units`` tool at the top right, which allows you to select the units you would like to see for quantities in the GUI.
