# NOMAD Users

The NOMAD software offers a [wide range of extendable functionalities](./M1_1_RDM_with_NOMAD.md) to support FAIR research data management. Similarly, individuals with a diverse and dynamic spectrum of needs and skills interact with NOMAD. Therefore, understanding your roles and responsibilities with respect to RDM in a research project is important for the effective utilization of NOMAD.

In general, individuals who interact with NOMAD can be categorized into three groups: 'Users', 'Application Administrators', and 'System Administrators'. This classification is not absolute and can have overlaps, depending on the RDM needs of researchers, research groups, or institutes.

### User (Researcher)
Users are scientists who directly interact with the NOMAD software. They upload datasets, search for data, and use applications within the NOMAD software. The majority of NOMAD functionalities are developed to support this user group with their RDM needs.

### Application Administrator
Application administrators, also known as data stewards or data scientists, are responsible for implementing or creating use-case applications within NOMAD. This role requires an understanding of NOMAD, as well as proficiency in Python programming and tools like Jupyter. They build applications for the researchers to address their specific RDM requirements.

### System Administrator
System administrators set up local NOMAD installations (NOMAD Oasis) on servers of a university or a research institute. Their responsibilities include configuring and maintaining the server and managing access. In addition to the requirements described for the Application Administrators, this role also requires knowledge of Docker and Keycloak.

In this onboarding workshop, our main target group will be NOMAD users (researchers), with a tendency to extend it towards the needs of application administrators or advanced users in different parts to ensure a comprehensive understanding and effective use of NOMAD functionalities.
