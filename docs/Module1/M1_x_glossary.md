### Key Terms

[Archive](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#archive): Processed data stored in NOMAD. The entirety of all processed data is referred to as the Archive. Sometimes used to refer to the processed data of a particular entry.

[Dataset](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#dataset): Users can organize entries into datasets. Datasets can be compared to albums, labels, or tags on other platforms. Users can obtain a DOI for their datasets.

[ELN (Electronic Lab Notebook)](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#eln): Editable entries in NOMAD for documenting research activities, offering form fields and widgets to modify contents.

[Entry](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#entry): A database entry in NOMAD, identified by an entry id. Entries are associated with raw files and have individual pages on the NOMAD GUI.

[Mainfile](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#mainfile): Each entry has one raw file that defines it. This is called the mainfile of that entry.

[Metadata](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#metadata): A specific technical subset of processed data, including ids, timestamps, authors, datasets, references, and schema information.

[Metainfo](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#metainfo): The sum of all schemas. It includes all pre-defined schemas used to represent processed data in a standardized way.

[Parser](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#parser): A program that converts raw data files into NOMAD's structured format, transforming information from a specific source format.

[Processed data](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#processed-data): The outcome of parsing and normalizing raw data files. Processed data always follows a schema.

[Quantity](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#quantity): The smallest referable unit of processed data, which can have many types and shapes, such as strings, numbers, lists, or matrices.

[Raw file](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#raw-file): Any file provided by a NOMAD user. Raw files always belong to an upload and might be associated with an entry.

[Results (section `results`)](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#results): A particular section of processed data comprising a summary of the most relevant data for an entry.

[Schema](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#schema): Defines possible data structures for processed data, organizing data hierarchically in sections and subsections.

[Section and Subsection](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#section-and-subsection): Sections provide hierarchy and organization for processed data, while quantities refer to the actual pieces of data.

[Upload](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/glossary.html#upload): Raw files organized and submitted to NOMAD, which can be shared and published. Uploads consist of raw files and a list of respective entries.
