# Building Your Customized ELN Template

In the previous section, you documented your experiment in the NOMAD ELN by using the built-in schema provided by NOMAD. 

While the built-in NOMAD ELN schemas are highly versatile, they can sometimes be too general, which might limit their applicability when specific input fields are required for your research. These input fields might not always cover all the quantities that you want to include in the structured data model within NOMAD.

However, one of the key advantages of NOMAD is the flexibility it offers: you can create your own customized ELN tailored to your specific needs. These custom ELNs are based on NOMAD's schema language, known as NOMAD metainfo, allowing you to build a more precise and relevant data structure for your research.

In this section, you will learn:
- How to create an ELN template using YAML files.
- The data structure of NOMAD. 
- How to control the interactivity of different fields in your ELN.
