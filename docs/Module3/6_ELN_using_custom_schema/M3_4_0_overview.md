# Building Your Customized ELN Template

In the previous section, you documented your experimen using NOMAD's built-in schemas. While these built-in NOMAD ELN schemas are versatile, they may sometimes be too general, limiting their applicability if specific input fields are required for your research. These input fields might not always cover all the quantities that you want to include in the structured data model within NOMAD.

However, a key advantage of NOMAD is its flexibility: you can create your own customized ELN tailored to your specific needs. Using NOMAD's schema language, known as NOMAD metainfo, you can build a more precise and relevant data structure for your research.

In this section, you will learn:

- How to create an ELN template using YAML files.
- The data structure of NOMAD. 
- How to control the interactivity of different fields in your ELN.
