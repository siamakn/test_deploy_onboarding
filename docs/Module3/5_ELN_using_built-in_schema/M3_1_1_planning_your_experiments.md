# Planning Your Expriment

Planning is the critical first step in effectively conducting your experiments to obtain meaningful results and conclusions. This is the foundation for taking full advantage of NOMAD's ELN functionality and the ELN's built-in schemas.

 This involves several key actions:

1. **Identify Materials and Instruments**: Identify the materials and instruments that will be essential throughout your experiments.

2. **Create a Sample List**: Compile a comprehensive list of samples that will either be used or prepared for your experiments.

3. **Define Processes and Conditions**: Clearly outline the processes, instruments, and conditions required to accurately prepare the samples.

4. **Listing of Measurements**: Develop a detailed list of measurements that will be used to examine the prepared samples.

5. **Define Experimental Workflows**: Establish clear experimental workflows that cover each step from sample preparation to measurements and analysis.

By carefully completing these planning tasks, you will lay a solid foundation for the smooth execution and meaningful results of your scientific endeavors.
