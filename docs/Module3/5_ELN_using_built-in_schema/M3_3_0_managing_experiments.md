# Managing Your Experiments

Once you have defined all the substances, samples, processes, and measurements involved in your experimental work, you can start creating workflows that connect all these elements into a cohesive overview of the entire experiment. NOMAD's ELN offers a specially designed schema to help you do this: the *Experiment ELN*.

## Experiment ELN: Integrating Your Experiment

The *Experiment ELN* schema allows you to reference all the entries of processes and measurements as steps within a single NOMAD entry that describes the complete experiment. 

By using this schema, you can easily visualize how all the different parts of your experiment connect and flow together. This creates a structured and traceable record of your work, ensuring that every detail is documented in context.

Benefits of the Experiment ELN Schema

- **Integrated Experiment View:** See all related processes and measurements in one place.
- **Simplified Workflow Management:** Create clear, step-by-step documentation of your experiment.
- **Enhanced Traceability:** Easily trace the origins and relationships between various experimental components. 

## NOMAD as a File-Based System

NOMAD operates as a file-based system, meaning that each entry you create is stored as a file within your upload folder. This structure has several advantages:

### **Organizing and Managing Files**

- **Folder Structure:** You can organize your entries into folders, similar to how you would on your computer. This allows for a clean and logical arrangement of all your experimental data.
- **File Management:** Besides entries, you can also upload other types of files, such as images, PDFs, or supplementary documents. These files can be stored and organized within the same structure, making NOMAD a powerful tool for managing all your experiment-related files.

### **Shared Drive Capabilities**

NOMAD's file-based nature also means that it can function as an online shared drive. This enables collaboration with your team, as everyone with access can view, edit, and contribute to the same set of files. The shared drive feature is particularly useful for distributed teams or when working across different locations.

### **Backup and Download**

For peace of mind, NOMAD allows you to download the entire upload folder to your local machine. This ensures that you have a backup of all your work, safeguarding against data loss.
