# Managing Your Experiments

After carefully planning your experiments and thoroughly documenting all entities and activities involved, the next crucial step is to effectively manage them. Efficient experiment management is essential for maintaining organization and ensuring the quality of research outcomes.

In NOMAD, the experiment management process involves integrating multiple (meta)data records into a single experiment, establishing a clear workflow, and creating comprehensive connections to all entries using the built-in schemas. NOMAD also facilitates recording and analyzing data. By using NOMAD's features, you can streamline the experimental process, ensuring accurate documentation, efficient workflow management, and thorough analysis. This leads to robust and reliable research outcomes.

<!-- 
- The word "workflow" in its english meaning has been used in the past 2 sections. Here the NOMAD specific workflow is meant.
- I suggest to use "(meta)data records" instead of "records", so that the reader is seeing less NOMAD specific terms. 
- entries can also be connected through custom schemas, therefore  removed "built-in".

This is accomplished by creating references between entries, such as entities or activities. For example, you can link all the measurements performed on a single sample, or reference each prepared sample to its constituents.
