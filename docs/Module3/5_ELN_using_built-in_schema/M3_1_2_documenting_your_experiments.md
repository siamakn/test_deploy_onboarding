# Documenting Your Experiments

After carefully planning your experiments, the next critical step is to document those plans and their excution by creating a record for each entity and activity involved in your experiment. Using NOMAD as an ELN for documentation ensures a thorough and efficient record of your experimental strategies.

Here's how to document your plans with NOMAD:

1. **Record Materials and Instruments**: Create a record for each substance, tool, and instrument that will be used in your experiment, including detailed descriptions and relevant parameters. 


2. **List Samples and Preparations**: Document the list of samples to be used or prepared, along with their specific characteristics and preparation methods.

3. **Outline Measurement Parameters**: Clearly define the measurements performed to study the samples, specifying the parameters and techniques to be used.

4. **Document Experimental Procedures**: Describe the experimental workflow from sample preparation through measurements and analysis, ensuring that each step is meticulously recorded.

By documenting your experimental plans with NOMAD, you create a comprehensive record that not only helps maintain clarity and organization, but also facilitates reproducibility and collaboration with other researchers.

NOMAD offers specifically tailored built-in schemas that can be used to create the records mentioned above: 

| Entity or Activity | NOMAD ELN schema |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Materials | *Substance ELN*| 
| Tools or instruments | *Instrument ELN*|
| Samples | *Generic sample ELN*|
| Sample preparation | *Material processing ELN*|
| Characterization | *Measurement ELN*| 
| Experiment | *Experiment ELN*|
