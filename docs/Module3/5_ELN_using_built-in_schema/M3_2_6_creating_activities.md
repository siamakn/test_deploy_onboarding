# **Create Entries for the Activities of Your Experiments:**

Now that you have created the record for the entities of your experiments, the next step is to create the **activities** involved in your experiments.

Activities include:

* **Sample preparation**
* **Characterizing the samples**

We will first document the preparation procedure for our samples, i.e., the P3HT in chloroform solvent and the P3HT thin film on glass. 
For this, we will use the built-in ELN schema *Material Processing ELN*. 

This schema allows the processes to be linked to the equipment used, the substances used as input materials, and the samples resulting from the process. 

In addition, workflows can be automatically created and modified to generate a visual graph representing the process. 

Go to the next section for a step-by-step illustration of how to create an activity record using the *Material Processing ELN* schema, and an explanation of the different features that can be used.
